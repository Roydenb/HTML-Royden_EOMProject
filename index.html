    <h2 class="heading-2">RedBull?</h2>
    <p>
Red Bull is an energy drink sold by Red Bull GmbH, an Austrian company created in 1987. Red Bull has the highest market share of any energy drink in the world, 
with 7.5 billion cans sold in a year (as of 2019).[7][8][9][10]
Austrian entrepreneur Dietrich Mateschitz was inspired by an existing energy drink named Krating Daeng, 
which was first introduced and sold in Thailand by Chaleo Yoovidhya. He took this idea, modified the ingredients to suit the tastes of Westerners,
and, in partnership with Chaleo, founded Red Bull GmbH in 1987 in Chakkapong, Thailand. 
In Thai, daeng means red, and a krating (known in English as a gaur or Indian bison) is a large species of wild bovine native to South Asia. 
Yoovidhya's heirs own majority stakes in both brands, 
and they both use the same red bull on yellow sun logo while continuing to market the separate drinks to the respective Thai and Western markets.

Red Bull is sold in a tall and slim blue-silver can.
Originally only available in a single nondescript flavor and regular or sugar-free formulas, 
a line of "color editions" with artificial fruit flavors were added to the line beginning in 2013.
 The Red Bull company slogan is "Red Bull gives you wings",occasionally "No Red Bull, no wings". 
Rather than following a traditional approach to mass marketing, Red Bull has generated awareness and created a 'brand myth'
[15][16] through proprietary extreme sport event series such as Red Bull Cliff Diving World Series, 
Red Bull Air Race, Red Bull Crashed Ice and stand-out stunts such as the Stratos space diving project.

Red Bull's marketing also includes multiple sports team ownerships (Formula One teams Red Bull Racing and Scuderia AlphaTauri,
 football clubs RB Leipzig,
 FC Red Bull Salzburg, FC Liefering, Red Bull Brasil and New York Red Bulls), 
 celebrity endorsements, and music, through its record label Red Bull Records.

Energy drinks have been associated with health risks, such as masking the effects of intoxication when consumed with alcohol,
[19] and excessive or repeated consumption can lead to cardiac and psychiatric conditions.[20][21] 
However, 
the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) concluded that a moderate consumption of Red Bull and other popular energy drinks is safe and that the amount of 
caffeine in a standard Red Bull can is unlikely to interact adversely with other typical constituents of energy drinks or with alcohol.
Energy drinks have the effects that caffeine and sugar give, but there is no distinct evidence that the wide variety of other ingredients has any effect.

  <h2>
      The History of Red Bull.
  </h2>
  <p><strong>
      How did we get started and how did we get till where we are at right now?
  </p></strong>
  <p>In 1976, Chaleo Yoovidhya introduced a drink called Krating Daeng in Thailand, which means "red gaur" in English. It was popular among Thai truck drivers and labourers. While working for German manufacturer Blendax (later acquired by Procter & Gamble) in 1982, Dietrich Mateschitz travelled to Thailand and met Chaleo, owner of T.C. Pharmaceutical. During his visit, Mateschitz discovered that Krating Daeng helped cure his jet lag.[24] In 1984, Mateschitz co-founded Red Bull GmbH with Yoovidhya and turned it into an international brand. Each partner invested US$500,000 of savings to found the company. Yoovidhya and Mateschitz each held a 49 percent share of the new company. They gave the remaining two percent to Yoovidhya's son, Chalerm, but it was agreed that Mateschitz would run the company.[25] The product was launched in Austria in 1987.

    In Thailand, energy drinks are most popular with blue-collar workers. Red Bull re-positioned the drink as a trendy, upscale drink, first introducing it at Austrian ski resorts. Pricing was a key differentiator, with Red Bull positioned as a premium drink and Krating Daeng as a lower cost item. In many countries, both drinks are available, dominating both ends of the price spectrum.[26]
    
    In 1992, the product expanded to Hungary and Slovenia.[27] It entered Germany and the UK in 1994,[27] the United States (via California) in 1997[27] and the Middle East in 2000.[28] In 2008, Forbes magazine listed both Chaleo and Mateschitz as the 250th richest people in the world with an estimated net worth of US$4 billion.[29][30]
    
    Red Bull GmbH is headquartered in Fuschl am See, an Austrian village of about 1,500 inhabitants near Salzburg. The company is 51 percent controlled by the Yoovidhya family who, for technical reasons, own the trademark in Europe and the US.[26]
    
    In 1995, Krating Daeng authorized its drink, labelled as Red Bull, to be sold in China. Since 2014, the Austrian Red Bull (carbonated) has also been exported to China. This has created confusion since both drinks use the same brand name, in both English and Chinese.
    
    Similarly, in Southeast Asia, Red Bull and Krating Daeng are often confused as both use the Red Bull name in their packaging, although they are two separate products aimed at different markets. The main difference is that Red Bull comes in a tall blue and silver can while the Thailand Red Bull, or Krating Daeng, is in a smaller gold can. The two drinks also differ in terms of taste—Red Bull has less sugar and is carbonated. The flavouring used for Red Bull is still produced in Bangkok and exported worldwide.[26]

  <h2>
      Our Ingredients
  </h2>
  <p>
    Depending on the country, Red Bull contains different amounts of caffeine, taurine, B vitamins (B3, B5, B6, B12) and simple sugars (sucrose and glucose) in a buffer solution of carbonated water, baking soda and magnesium carbonate.[32][33] To produce Red Bull Sugarfree, sugars sucrose and glucose have been replaced by the sweeteners acesulfame K and aspartame/sucralose.[34]

    Previous formulations of Red Bull contained 0.24% glucuronolactone (600 mg of glucuronolactone in a 250 ml can),[35] but this ingredient was removed.
