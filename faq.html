    <h2> 
        #1 .Is there possible side effects of drinking Red BUll?
    </h2>

    <p>
       <ul>

           <li>
            Can increase blood pressure and heart rate

            Blood pressure and heart rate are two important measures for heart health, as increased levels have been associated with a higher risk of hypertension (high blood pressure) and heart disease (4Trusted Source, 5Trusted Source).
            
            Several studies in healthy adults have shown that drinking one 12-ounce (355-ml) can of Red Bull significantly increased blood pressure and heart rate levels within 90 minutes and up to 24 hours after consumption (6Trusted Source, 7Trusted Source, 8Trusted Source, 9Trusted Source).
            
            These increases in heart rate and blood pressure are thought to be largely due Red Bull’s caffeine content, as one large 12-ounce (355-ml) can contains 108 mg of caffeine — about the same amount as a cup of coffee (2Trusted Source, 10Trusted Source, 11Trusted Source).
            
            Despite these increases, moderate and occasional intake of Red Bull is unlikely to cause serious heart problems in healthy adults.
            
            Still, excess intake — particularly in younger people — has been linked to abnormal heart rhythm, heart attack, and even death (11Trusted Source, 12, 13Trusted Source).
            
            Additionally, while research is limited, drinking Red Bull could worsen heart health and be life-threatening in individuals with pre-existing high blood pressure or heart disease (11Trusted Source). 
           </li>

           <li>
            May increase type 2 diabetes risk

            Excess sugar intake, especially from sweetened beverages, may increase your risk of type 2 diabetes (14Trusted Source).
            
            In fact, a review in 310,819 adults found that drinking 1–2 servings of sugar-sweetened beverages per day was associated with a significant 26% increased risk of type 2 diabetes (14Trusted Source).
            
            As Red Bull is sugar-sweetened — providing 29 grams of sugar in one 8.4-ounce (260-ml) serving — drinking one or more servings per day could increase your risk of type 2 diabetes (2Trusted Source). 
           </li>
           
           <li>
            May damage your teeth

            Research indicates that drinking acidic beverages can damage tooth enamel, which is the hard outer coating that helps protect your teeth against decay (15Trusted Source).
            
            Red Bull is an acidic beverage. As a result, regular intake may harm your tooth enamel (16Trusted Source).
            
            One 5-day test-tube study found that exposing human tooth enamel to energy drinks for 15 minutes, 4 times a day resulted in significant and irreversible loss of tooth enamel (17Trusted Source).
            
            Furthermore, the study noted that energy drinks were twice as harmful to tooth enamel than soft drinks (17Trusted Source).
           </li>

           <li>
            May negatively affect kidney health

            While occasionally drinking Red Bull is unlikely to have any serious effects on kidney health, research suggests that chronic and excessive intake could.
            
            A 12-week study in rats found that chronic intake of Red Bull may cause a decline in kidney function. However, these results have not been replicated in human studies (18).
            
            Additionally, research indicates a link between high sugar intake and an increased risk of chronic kidney disease (19Trusted Source, 20Trusted Source, 21Trusted Source).
            
            As Red Bull is high in sugar, frequent and excessive intake may increase your risk. 
           </li>

           <li>
            May increase high-risk behavior

            Research has shown an association between drinking Red Bull and increased high-risk behavior, especially when combined with alcohol (1Trusted Source).
            
            When consumed together, caffeine in Red Bull can mask the effects of alcohol, making you feel less intoxicated while still experiencing alcohol-related impairments (22Trusted Source, 23Trusted Source, 24Trusted Source).
            
            This effect can have serious consequences.
            
            One study found that college-aged students who drank energy drinks and alcohol together were more likely to drink and drive and experience serious alcohol-related injuries than when alcohol was consumed alone (25Trusted Source).
            
            Even when not paired with alcohol, observational studies indicate that in young adults, regular intake of energy drinks like Red Bull is linked to an increased risk of alcohol dependence and illicit drug use (22Trusted Source, 26Trusted Source, 27Trusted Source).
            
            Of course, not everyone who drinks Red Bull will experience an increase in high-risk behaviors. Still, it’s important to be aware of the potential risks, especially in younger adults and when alcohol is involved. 
           </li>

           <li>
            May lead to caffeine overdose and possible toxicity

            While safe doses of caffeine vary by individual, current research recommends limiting caffeine to 400 mg per day or less in healthy adults (28Trusted Source).
            
            As one small 8.4-ounce (260-ml) can of Red Bull provides 75 mg of caffeine, drinking more than 5 cans per day could increase your risk of caffeine overdose (2Trusted Source).
            
            However, the average half-life of caffeine in the blood ranges from 1.5–9.5 hours, which means it could take up to 9.5 hours for your caffeine blood levels to drop to half of its original amount (29Trusted Source).
            
            As a result, it’s hard to determine the exact amount of Red Bull that could lead to caffeine overdose.
            
            Additionally, adolescents under the age of 19 may be at a greater risk of caffeine-related side effects (30Trusted Source).
            
            Current recommendations call for limiting caffeine to 100 mg or less per day in adolescents aged 12–19. Therefore, drinking more than one 8.4-ounce (260-ml) serving of Red Bull could increase the risk of caffeine overdose in this age group (28Trusted Source).
            
            Symptoms of caffeine overdose and toxicity can include nausea, vomiting, hallucinations, anxiety, rapid heart rate, dizziness, trouble sleeping, and seizures (31Trusted Source).

 <h2>
     #2. Is it safe to drink Red Bull everyday?
 </h2>

 <p>
    Despite what some people think, moderate amounts of caffeine are actually very good for you. Also, Red Bull is certainly not the strongest energy drink

    in the world, it has only 80mg of caffeine per 8.4 fl.oz (250ml) can.
    
    The energy boost experienced after drinking Red Bull or other energy drinks isn’t just due to caffeine and taurine, although caffeine is certainly the most important ingredient in any energy drink
    
    .
    
    Actually, the boost that you feel is from those ingredients, plus everything else that’s included such as B group vitamins, ginseng, and other ingredients, depending on which energy drink that you choose.
    
    But, there is no denying the fact that caffeine has by far the biggest impact on the energy boost that you feel after drinking an energy drink.
    
    Getting back to this specific question, is it safe to drink Red Bull daily, the answer is yes, it is safe.
    
    The main things you should probably consider before choosing to do so are:
    
        is 80mg of caffeine per can suitable for you?
        Is 27g of sugar per can suitable for you?
        Are the 110 calories per can suitable for you?
    
    For most people, the caffeine and calories won’t be an issue. However, the 27g of sugar should cause you to consider your options.
    
    Perhaps you could go for a sugar-free Red Bull instead of the regular version, that would be a decent solution if you want to limit your sugar intake.
    
    The bottom line is, if you are an otherwise healthy person, with an otherwise healthy and balanced diet, drinking Red Bull daily is perfectly safe.
    
    A related question is how much would that cost you, but that’s a topic for another conversation.

     #4. What effect does Taurine have on My Muscles?
 </h2>

 <p>
    Effects of Taurine on MuscleTaurine is found in high concentrations in skeletal muscles and plays an important role in modulating contractile function (5). 
     Taurine increases force generation by enhancing Sarcoplasmic Reticulum’s Ca2+ accumulation and release (5). 
      Increasing taurine levels also augments the mean rate of increase in the force response.  
      It is suggested that balancing the endogenous taurine concentrations is crucial for maintaining the appropriate force output during muscle contraction. 
     Muscle fibers possibly modulate their contractility by increasing or decreasing the intracellular taurine levels in response to neuronal inputs (5).  
     From examining taurine’s role in muscle contraction, it may seem possible that increasing the body’s taurine concentration through dietary intake, 
     e.g. Red Bull consumption, can enhance force generation.  
     However, no definitive study exists on the absorption rate of taurine following dietary ingestion and/or incorporation rate into muscle cells. 
      Furthermore, considering that the intracellular taurine concentration is critically regulated, 
     it seems unlikely that an increase in plasma level of taurine following taurine consumption would greatly perturb this closely regulated balance.
